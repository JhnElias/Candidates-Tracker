This is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to copy links from the tab that you want.
 Lets say that you are a reqruiter and you search on LinkedIn for new candidates for a job. With a push of a button you can grab the url and have it on your browsers local memory. 
 When you have all the links for your candidates, you can hit "Download Data" and download your links on a txt file at your downloads file, so that you can have all the profiles you need at your PC. When you finish with the links that you want you can double click "Delete Data" button and delete all of your data from your local memory. Most of the javaScript code has comments so that you can understand how it works. Feel free to download the code and use it as an extension on your Google Chrome browser to see how it works.
